## 2. Structure

| File / Folder | Description |
|----------------|--------------|
| **overview.md** | You are here â€” index of all documentation files. |
| **architecture.md** | System design, data flow, and integration between backend, data, and UI |
| **backend.md** | Backend API endpoints, database connection details |

## 3. Documentation Guidelines  

To keep documentation **consistent** and **easy to navigate**, every subteam should:  

1. **Update documentation alongside code changes.**  
   - When you finish a new feature, update the relevant `.md` file in this folder.  
2. **Follow consistent formatting.**  
   - Use clear section headers (`##`), bullet points, and short paragraphs.   
3. **Avoid duplication.**  
   - Link to other files instead of rewriting the same content. Example:  
     See [architecture.md](architecture.md)
